# Ethos Lens

Ethos Lens is an experimental, **read-only browser extension** that explores how on-chain reputation signals can be surfaced directly inside social platforms.

Instead of moderating, blocking, or ranking users, Ethos Lens focuses on **contextual visibility**:  
it shows how an account is perceived through reputation data — **without enforcing behavior or altering feeds**.

This project is a **prototype and research experiment** around trust, signal quality, and ethical UX primitives.

## What Ethos Lens Does

- Reads public reputation or trust-related signals  
- Displays them as non-intrusive visual indicators on social profiles  
- Does **not** block content, shadowban users, or modify timelines  
- Keeps the user in control: **no judgments, only signals**

> This is not a moderation tool.  
> **It is a reputation mirror.**

## Why This Matters

Today’s social platforms reward **volume, noise, and coordination** — not trust.

Ethos Lens explores a different idea:

> What if reputation didn’t punish or reward,  
> but simply reflected how actions are perceived?

By making trust signals visible (but optional), users can make more informed decisions **without centralized enforcement**.

## Current State

- Browser extension prototype (Chrome-compatible)  
- Read-only, client-side only  
- No data writes, no tracking  
- Experimental UI and logic  

This repository represents an **early-stage prototype**, not a production-ready product.

## Vision

Ethos Lens is part of a broader exploration into:

- Trust-weighted visibility  
- Ethical UX for reputation systems  
- On-chain attestations as social primitives  
- User-sovereign signal interpretation  

Future iterations may integrate:

- On-chain attestations (e.g. **EAS on Base**)  
- ZK-friendly verification layers  
- Configurable signal thresholds

## Disclaimer

This project is experimental and provided **as-is**.  
No guarantees. No enforcement. No social scoring.

**Just signals — and choice.**
